PROJECT 1-predicting the value of whether a student will get a red diploma or not, using logistic regression and a ROC curve.
Changes were made to the model: removed outliers from the independent variable, and used step to select the optimal model for prediction. The changes improved the efficiency of the predicted model. For test data, this increase was 4 %: from 74% to 78%.
