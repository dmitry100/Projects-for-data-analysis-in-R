                                              PROJECT 1		
PROJECT 1-predicting the value of whether a student will get a red diploma or not, using logistic regression and a ROC curve.
Changes were made to the model: removed outliers from the independent variable, and used step to select the optimal model for prediction. The changes improved the efficiency of the predicted model. For test data, this increase was 4 %: from 74% to 78%.


                                               PROJECT 2 

A nationwide survey of hospital costs conducted by the US Agency for Healthcare consists of hospital records of inpatient samples. The given data is restricted to the city of Wisconsin and relates to patients in the age group 0-17 years. I want to analyze the data to research on the healthcare costs and their utilization.

Here is a detailed description of the given dataset:
AGE : Age of the patient discharged
FEMALE : Binary variable that indicates if the patient is female
LOS : Length of stay, in days
RACE : Race of the patient (specified numerically)
TOTCHG : Hospital discharge costs
APRDRG : All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups
